## Description

Currency converter is a simple tool that allows you to convert PLN to one of three currencies: EUR, USD, CHF. Just enter the amount to be converted in the appropriate place and select the chosen currency from the list.

I used Visual Studio Code, Cascading Style Sheets and JavaScript to develop this tool.
